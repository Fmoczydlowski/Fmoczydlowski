## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ‘‹ Yo, I'm Filip MoczydÅ‚owski â€“ a Web Developer with Power!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a web developer by profession, but C programming will always have a special place in my heart. Obsessed with modern web technologies, but never forgetful of the rock-solid foundations. Every project is a mission, and every line of code is crafted with purpose.

## ðŸ’¼ About Me

- ðŸŽ“ **Education**: Engineering in Web Systems & C Programming â€“ yeah, I dominate both worlds
- ðŸ’» **Interests**: Web Development (obviously), Frontend & Backend, C Programming (because code is art), AI (especially CNNs), and of course â€“ breaking systems (security testing, baby!)
- ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning**: Advanced Node.js, React.js, and some C wizardry to make web apps faster than ever
- âš¡ **Fun Fact**: Even when I write JavaScript, there's a C program compiling in my brain. Control freak? Maybe. Powerful? Absolutely.

## ðŸš€ Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C, JavaScript (ES6+), Python, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks**: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Others**: Git, Docker, CI/CD, Linux (Kali and PoP!_OS)

*Thanks for stopping by! Code isn't just a job for me â€“ it's a way of life. Let's connect, build some killer web apps, or talk C code over coffee. Trust me, I bring the power.*
